# PWA HTTPS Fix

## Issue

The Progressive Web App (PWA) functionality works correctly in localhost but not in production. This is because:

1. PWAs require HTTPS to work in production environments
2. Browsers make an exception for localhost, allowing PWAs to work over HTTP in local development
3. In production, if the application is served over HTTP instead of HTTPS, the service worker won't register and the PWA features won't work

## Solution

To fix this issue, you need to ensure that your application is served over HTTPS in production. Here are the steps to implement this:

### 1. Configure HTTPS for your production server

Depending on your hosting environment, you'll need to:

- Set up an SSL certificate (Let's Encrypt provides free certificates)
- Configure your web server (Nginx, Apache, etc.) to use HTTPS
- Redirect HTTP traffic to HTTPS

### 2. For Nginx (common setup)

If you're using Nginx as a reverse proxy, add the following configuration:

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name your-domain.com;
    
    # Redirect all HTTP requests to HTTPS
    return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
}

server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    server_name your-domain.com;
    
    # SSL certificate configuration
    ssl_certificate /path/to/fullchain.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /path/to/privkey.pem;
    
    # Other SSL settings
    ssl_protocols TLSv1.2 TLSv1.3;
    ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on;
    ssl_ciphers ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-ECDSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:ECDHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:DHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384;
    
    # Proxy to your Next.js application
    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;  # Adjust to your application's port
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }
}
```

### 3. For Docker/Kubernetes environments

If you're using Docker or Kubernetes, you might want to:

1. Use an ingress controller with HTTPS support
2. Configure TLS termination at the ingress level
3. Ensure proper headers are passed to your application

### 4. Using a CDN or hosting service

If you're using a CDN or hosting service like Vercel, Netlify, or Cloudflare:

1. Enable HTTPS in your hosting dashboard
2. Configure automatic HTTP to HTTPS redirects
3. Ensure your custom domain has a valid SSL certificate

## Verification

After implementing HTTPS, verify that:

1. Your application is accessible via HTTPS
2. The browser shows a secure connection (lock icon in the address bar)
3. The PWA can be installed from the production environment
4. The service worker is registered correctly (check in DevTools > Application > Service Workers)
