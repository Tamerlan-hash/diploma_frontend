# PWA Icons

This directory should contain the following icon files for the Progressive Web App (PWA) functionality:

1. `icon-192x192.png` - 192x192 pixel icon
2. `icon-384x384.png` - 384x384 pixel icon
3. `icon-512x512.png` - 512x512 pixel icon

These icons are referenced in the `manifest.json` file and are required for the PWA to work properly.

You can create these icons by:
1. Using an existing logo or image
2. Resizing it to the required dimensions
3. Saving it in PNG format with the appropriate filename

For best results, the icons should:
- Be square
- Have a transparent background
- Be clearly visible at different sizes
- Represent your brand or application

You can use image editing tools like Photoshop, GIMP, or online tools to create these icons.
